The long drawn out protracted transfer saga is actually over. I cannot believe it. Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Alexander Risak. This is enormous. I cannot believe that this is actually happening. One of the biggest transfers in Premier League history is actually going to happen. This is a British transfer record. Liverpool are breaking their transfer record twice in the same summer. They are doing their best to secure dynasty. They are doing their best to secure legacy and they are doing their best to make history and they have backed on slot. Anoslot deserves a backing. You look at what he did when he came into Liverpool. You look at what he did building on that club era. You look at what he did winning the league in his first season, marrying up his version and vision of Dutch control, a slower tempo, but marrying it up with Jurgen Klopp's approach which was all rock and roll. And I cannot believe that this has actually happened. Now this is up there with Robin Van Persie leaving Arsenal to go and sign for Manchester United and take the league to Manchester United that year. He won the league for Manchester United. That is the significance of that signing. This is up there with Ashley Cole from Arsenal to Chelsea. This is up there with Fernando Torres from Liverpool to Chelsea. This is enormous. This is a moment sometimes in football you just have to take a moment, sit back and acknowledge that you are witnessing history. Alexander Isac, one of the most talented and prodigious talents in world football, has just joined the champions. Alexander Isach has shown the world that you can get out of a contract when you need to get out of a contract. And Harry Kane will be watching these events thinking, why on earth didn't I do the same thing. Now, I have often spoken about what this signing means. I've often spoken about why this is all about dynasty because this isn't about winning the league next year. This isn't about retaining the Premier League for Liverpool. This isn't about any singular season. This is truly about history. This is truly about making history, not reliving it. This is about securing another era of dominance, securing an era that is capable and comparable of doing wonderful things and being comparable to the very best. This is up there with what Liverpool have done before. What they are trying to do here is emulate what Liverpool did in the late 70s, in the early 80s. This is this is trying to make Liverpool an unstoppable force in the way that they were once before. Think of that era where Liverpool were just incomparable to anyone else. The late '7s, the early 80s. Pick any team. What the the 81 team, the 81 team that went to Paris, beat Real Madrid in a European final. Think about why that Liverpool team was so good. Think about why that Liverpool team that lit up the Parisian sky was so iconic. Why? The answer I can give you, it's the spine. It's the icons. Clemens, Hansen, Sunnes, Kenny, Douglas. And what Liverpool trying to do here in a very different way is borrow from that formula. Icon after icon. The reason why Emilyn Hughes lifted a European Cup in Rome, lit up the sky there. The reason why that happened was icon after icon after icon. The reason why it happened in Paris, as I just demonstrated, was icon after icon after icon. And now you look at this Liverpool team and you go Allison icon, Van Dijk icon, Salah icon, Alexander Isac, Florian Vertz, they are building something truly truly immeasurable. And when you think about what this could mean going forward, when you think about what this could mean for Liverpool of tomorrow, when they signed Muhammad Salah, they weren't as good as this. And Muhammad Salah didn't come with the reputation that Alexander is coming with. Muhammad Salah landed at Liverpool and he has gone on to break record after record. He has gone on to potentially break the Premier League goalcoring record. He has gone on to potentially unbelievably score more goals for Liverpool than Roger Hunt. Score more goals for Liverpool than Ian St. John. Score more goals for Liverpool than Steven Gerard. Score more goals for Liverpool than Billy Little. Think about who Billy Little was. Think about what Liverpool were when Little was playing for them. They were called Littlepool. That is the importance of Billy Little scoring goals for Liverpool. and Salah has surpassed him. That is what he has done. And I think that Muhammad Salah will be looking at what Ian Rush did for Liverpool. He'll be looking at that number and it feels insurmountable to everyone. Every rationale would say he'll never get there. But I believe that Muhammad Salah will be looking at that Ian Rush record thinking that he can get there. Now Alexander Isach is the same age as Muhammad Salah was when he landed at Liverpool. Alexander Isach is more of a natural goalcorer than Muhammad Salah. plays in a more goalcorer like position. He's also joining a team that was better. He's joining a more creative team. He's joining a team that has Muhammad Salah, the best version of Muhammad Salah in it. He's joining a team that has Florian vers, one of the most creative, devastating footballers in the world in it. He's joining a team that has Hugo Ekit. He's joining a team that are playing in a way that is about scoring goals. When Salah joined, he was joining a team. It was a great team. It's a dazzling team. It was a historic team. But it was Will Naom. It was Henderson. It wasn't as creative. Nowhere near as creative. And then you think about what he has already done in his goalc scoring records. Like Alexander Isac has currently got 54 goals in 86 games for Newcastle. 54 in 86 for Newcastle. Quite often a bad Newcastle team. Jacob Murphy, Joe Willook, Matt Target. That's who was supplying Alexander Isach. And yet he still managed to score 54 in 86. Now imagine. Now imagine him linking up with Florian versz. Imagine him playing a one-two with Muhammad Salah. I just can't believe what we are witnessing here. And I honestly believe that it could be history. Like if Isach improves upon that rate, there is no reason why Issach can't have some of the most devastating records in his sights. Why can't he get the 260? What can stop him getting the 260? He's going to have to do something unbelievable. But we've seen Muhammad Salah go into Liverpool and do unbelievable things. Like I don't think that Shira's 260 feels totally out of the question for a man of his talent. And when you think about what this means for Liverpool now this season like I think that Liverpool now are are on the cusp of something like truly magnificent. My prediction, my bold prediction for Liverpool now with Alexander Isach Centurions, Liverpool will get 100 points this season. There is no doubt in my mind that Liverpool will hit 100 points this season. They will win the league and I certainly see them being capable of winning the league but also going to Budapest to lift the European Cup. You can just see it now. You can just see it Kirk. You can just see it slightly lifting the European Cup in their home city. And I feel now that that just as just as Arsenal perhaps equalized and got closer to Liverpool, you know, Arsenal are a wonderful team. I always felt like Liverpool were in a better position. And I always felt that Arnos was a better manager than than Mikla Arteta. But just as the signing of EZ perhaps neutralized the distance between Liverpool and Arsenal and made it more of a more of a tight-knit race, you know, Liverpool conceded more goals than Arsenal last year. Arsenal had a better defensive record where Arsenal struggled with scoring goals. They couldn't break down teams that came to the Emirates or set up against Arsenal with a low block. They bring in Ocarez. They bring in a and suddenly think, \"Oh, maybe the gap between the two isn't what it what it was. Maybe there is a world where Liverpool could pip could Arsenal could pip Liverpool to the league.\" And then then what do they do? What do Liverpool do? Liverpool go out and they guarantee that they win the league. They surpass anything that Arsenal can offer. They already have the best manager in the league. They already have the best player in the league. They already have the best defender in the league. And now they have gone and they have signed the best striker in the league. That is ownership. That is ambition. And it is an unbelievable transfer window. It's a transfer window that Arnold slot earned. His magic deserved this transfer window. But when you think about what they have done in that transfer window, Friong replaced Trent Alexander Arnold with a plum. Kirk, they worked out that Andy Robertson is still a remarkable footballer and can still contribute massively to Liverpool this season, but they also worked out that he just needs a bit of help. Simass isn't good enough and Andy Robertson needs some help. And what do they do? They go out and they sign Kirk. They then make that statement marquee signing. the statement marquee signing that I didn't think could be built upon or matched this summer in signing Florian Verz but they then bring in somebody like Isach to play up front to play up front with Hugo Ekit to play up front instead of Hugo Ekit a player that can play both compliment and add to that front line and it is truly amazing. This is how you show your power as league champions. Liverpool are the biggest team in the country. Liverpool are the champions of this country and this is what you do when you are champions. You strengthen when you are strong. You bully the league. You remind the world of the food chain and Newcastle United needed to be reminded of that. They had the best striker in the league and they finished fifth. They've won one title in 100 years. Liverpool went and they showed their power. If you think about Manchester City's period of dominance in recent years, they never had a window like this. This is Abramovic like this is like total and utter dominance. This is a transfer window like no other from Liverpool. Something that we've never seen before and something that we haven't seen Liverpool do. Something that we've never seen them do. And that is why I believe they are trying to create a true dynasty. You look at Liverpool's dominance both domestically and in Europe in the late '7s right the way through to the early 80s. that Sunnes team, that Dagalish team, and then through into the Rush era. This is comparable. Like I say, it's signing icons. It's swooping for the very best. And Alexander Isac now is a Liverpool player. They have waited all summer for him, but they have got their man. Isach is on his way. And ultimately, Liverpool have won. They wanted their man. It was a fight and it went well 12 rounds, but Liverpool have landed a knockout blow. One of the biggest transfer sagas in Premier League history is over and Liverpool come out reigning supreme. Like, don't be surprised if the league table reads the same way come May. I can just see a world now where this could be a really intricate title race, but ultimately I believe that Liverpool are going to win the league by 10 points again. They were 10 points better than Arsenal last year and I think this signing will see them end 10 points clear of Arsenal again. Sometimes you just have to take a breath and you have to go I cannot believe that they have got their man. It is finally over. Alexander Isach has got his wish. His dream has come true. He will hear the cops sing his name. He is joining a behemoth. He is joining a team capable of dynasty. and he will get the honor of playing for a Liverpool team containing Muhammad Salah, Virgil van Djk and Allison. The lie of a bird is on his chest and I guarantee you this, the cop are going to sing about this day for decades to come. If this goes as I believe it will, Liverpool have just changed the shape of the Premier League for the long haul. Alexander Isak is 25 years old and he's one of the best footballers in the world. He is going on to become something great and I believe that there is a chance he could be a Liverpool great so much skill, so much natural ability and it can now all be honed by Anna slot and the standards will be set by Muhammad Salah and Virgil van Djk. Imagine this version of Liverpool and somebody convinced me that they can be stopped because both a boardroom level in the transfer market and now on the pitch there is no stopping this team. They'll end the season with over 100 points. Mark my words. Let me know your thoughts in the comments below. I just can't believe it. I can't rationalize it.

Good evening and welcome to the United Stands. I'm Mark Goldbridge and this is your latest Manchester United news and transfer news as the goalkeeping crisis starts to close in. Uh we are well starts to come to an end if we're being honest. Martinez not in the Aston Villa squad. Le's still an option. What's going on there? Also, we've got an update from our source around the midfielder in the last 24 hours of the transfer window. What's going on? Reiller of Stoutgart. Could anything happen there? Also, Jaden Sancho could be on the move to Aston Villa. Lots to get into. Plus, most important of all, it is uh an 8:00 show, so it's driven by you. So, get your thoughts in. This last 8:00 show of the summer transfer window. Remember, tomorrow night at 8:00, we'll be reviewing the transfer window, which will have closed at 700 p.m. So, get your thoughts in on that one. of course. Um there is no excuse not to sign a midfielder, but I could see Maz Rawi playing a few games in the midfield. I think he would do a decent job if we get them. Well, look, I suppose I will start on that one because the Martinez story and the Lemen story, I mean, you know, we pretty much know about it, but we know that Martinez wants Manchester United from Fitbitio and that is why he's not in the team. What are Man United going to do? I think they've got to go with Martinez. However, I apologize for the lateness in doing this because I was meant to do it on Friday. So throughout the summer, in fact it started in the international break. We've had a very good source at United who's been very very accurate. Anana in March, Will Cox and Amarim want him gone. Start of April Dilap was the priority. Uh Ganacho the morning after the final 100% leaving. Yuro Sunday will start the final of the Europa League final. Seemenu we were never in for it even though some reporters were talking about it. midfielder would not come in unless we got rid of a midfielder and also we had it first that Cowwell would be um Collier would be moved on. Um so a lot of uh good information across the summer. Um what are we hearing today from that source? Manchester United are in no talks with any midfielder as of tonight. No talks. There was a story this afternoon about Angelo Stiller from a couple of sources. Fabritzio Romano dismissed that straight away. That is not true. There are no talks with Stiller. We do not have representatives in Germany and there is no indication that Stog would sell and Man United are still not there. So what we're getting tonight from our source who's been very accurate is this. Manchester United are not in any talks for a midfielder. The expectation has to therefore be there will be no midfielder. However, from Ruben Amarim, he is absolutely adamant he needs a midfielder and he has never changed that stance. He wants a midfielder. Jason Wilcox wants a midfielder and if the door shuts without one, that will be against what they want. And further to that, if there was an opportunity to loan Manu and bring in a midfielder that Amarim wanted, he would do that on the basis that Mayu could come back next summer. So, I don't really think there's much more Amarim and Will Cox can do. Unfortunately, it's looking like they're going to get let down. So, you know, I mean, I just I I do wonder about the running of this football club, but then I remind myself who owns it, the Glazers. And I do think sometimes we forget that Sir Jim Radcliffe can only do so much. He doesn't own the football club. He can't write magic checks that are not there to be written. So, I think that um obviously there is still time in the window, but I don't I don't know. Um I don't know. I really don't know. Um thank you to the mods. There's a few [ __ ] tonight, so thank you very much for them. Um so, yeah, look, I don't know. I don't I don't I don't really don't know. I think Mayu is going to stay, as I say. I'm happy with that. But then again, he doesn't want to be here. Um, but it's disgusting to leave the midfield in that position. And it's disgusting because I think that the big thing for me is that when I watch the Arsenal Liverpool game today, those midfields are ridiculous. Both of them ridiculous. And the way that Liverpool defended especially, it wasn't their back four, it was their midfield as well. Your midfield is part of your defense. They're picking up the runners. They're part of the marking of space. We can't do that. We literally can't do that. So, I think that um United fans says Liverpool look trash. Well, it's not my fault you can't watch football. You know, we're here to talk about Man United and transfers, but if you can't watch football that I I can't teach you and I'm not going to. Liverpool defended ridiculously well as a unit and Arsenal couldn't break through it. We can't defend like that. We can't dig in and defend leads. We can't even do it against Burnley because our midfield can't support our defense. So if if this club is not going to give Amarim what he wants in the next 24 hours, I don't even understand it. From a footballing point of view, it's ridiculous because games are won and lost in the midfield. And from a financial point of view, it's ridiculous because you might have to sack hammer him now. If the midfield goes the way many of us think it will, we will lose a lot of games and he might lose his job. And that will cost you as much as it would cost you to bring a bloody midfielder in. I'm hoping. I'm hoping and what I've been told is as of tonight there are no talks but as of tonight Amry and Wilcox want a midfielder. So with 24 hours to go you know will anything happen? It's I don't think it does. I don't see how it does. I expect tomorrow morning somebody like David Ornstein will put out a post saying Man United's business is over apart from a goalkeeper. I'm fully expecting on that, but I think that it's disgusting. As for Connor Gallagher, there are rumors about Connor Gallagher leaving Atletico Madrid, but the biggest rumor is that Spurs can buy him for 43 million pounds. Spurs, Spurs have already got Bergwell, Saw, Bentanka, Kilisfki can play there. They've got someone else as well, haven't they? Who else have they got in their midfield? Bentanka, Bergal, Sar. There's someone else. But they've got loads of midfielders. We haven't. U Palinia. Yeah, Palinia. Yeah, bloody Palinia. Linda, you're right. Madness. So, doesn't look like we're going to get a midfielder. Very, very disappointing. But until the windows shut, who knows? Who knows? Would you take Bassuma at Man United? No. No. I mean, his attitude stinks. Don't. No. No. Absolutely not. No. Absolutely not. Um, would love your thoughts on if United can beat City with the players we have, plus new goalkeeper, says Jack. Look, we can beat Man City in a couple of weeks. We can beat Man City because we've beat Man City loads of times when people have said we can't beat Man City. We're more than capable of turning up for one game. Um, yeah, we can do it. I would never say that we can't. Um, why would Martinez join us without Champions League? Surely if he does, yet another mercenary. Do we need this? More power to players, says Eggy. Oh, interesting take there. I'm going to talk about the goalkeeper in a minute. Uh, Muhammad says, \"No midfielder is very disappointing, and not having one will make this season even harder, not easier. I think the manager will walk.\" Do you think Amarim uh knew that we weren't getting a midfielder, so that's why he wanted Bruno to stay, says James? I don't know. No, I don't think so, James, because he the decision to keep Bruno was June. Um, and he's wanted a midfielder all summer. We even went into talks with Belaba. I mean, what what what I find incredible, and I still don't know the reason for this other than pure incompetence. What I find incredible is that when I look back at this transfer window, we spent two weeks publicly talking to Belaba. Oh, David, you can tell them. Oh, for a Brit show, you can tell them. For two weeks, we were in talks with Bel Labour. Like, what an amazing signing that would have been. And it was all out there. And then we walked away and we're doing nothing. I can't get my head around the stupidity of that. I can't get my head around that. We spent two weeks publicly talking to a midfielder. We pulled out and then we're not gonna buy one. So, we've told the whole world we need a bloody midfielder and then we've gone nah, believe it. Even Fitzio said when we walked away from Belaba, that won't be the end of it. They'll be they'll go for another midfielder. You can find that tweet. You can find that clip. He said, \"When we walked away from Bourba, we'll go for another midfielder.\" I find it incredible. I find it absolutely incredible that this football club told the whole world they were going to buy a really good midfielder, walked away and haven't bought a midfielder. They've literally told you all we've got a problem in the midfield and now they're telling you all we're not going to do anything. It's crazy. Absolutely crazy. Um, anyone noticed the league table? I'm a believer MUFC says Fez. We needed goals last season and we got them in Kan and Burmo. We've strengthened. It's a good window with potential to be great. You're talking absolute shite, mate. But thank you very much for being positive. Um fart says mainly with the classic modern fid football footballer attitude. Swami says so sir Scrooge and Glazers donkeys don't want to spend or can't spend. Um also anyone thinking Belaba can happen next summer. Naive his value will go up. It's not happening. It's not happening. I'll tell you what's going to happen Swammy. I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen. we won't buy a midfielder and then on Tuesday morning we will absolutely leak to every journalist we can that we're going for belabour next summer and some of our fan base will swallow it like the naive prats they are because we do it every year and I don't like calling people naive prats but the evidence is there whenever a [ __ ] transfer window closes there's always a brief to all the journalists saying United are going to go strong next summer and you sort of like go well we never do and you sort of like go why didn't we go strong this summer and you sort of like go we're not a football club that can plan for the future we have to deal with today that's what Man United is you can't plan for the future because you have to deliver today rightly or wrongly which is why I'd go for Martinez over Lemens as I said before because there's not really much point buying um a project goalkeeper over one that's ready now because as we know with the press look today Look at the league table. We we lost to Arsenal. We drew with Fulham and we beat Burnley and it's Ammer him out. Pep Guardiola's team's [ __ ] and they've lost two from three and no one's no one cares. So that's why I'd go for Martinez because we will never be allowed to be patient and we will never be allowed to be a project even though we probably need to be one. So we've got to buy players for the now. That's why Emma is a good signing. That's why Kuna is a good signing and that's why Martinez would be a good signing. Three Premier League proven experienced players. Absolutely. Absolutely. Uh my favorite football experts in Norway sat down and watched all the Lemen's involvements in his last 25 matches. It was a horror show. No proof of quality. Do our scouts only look at highlight reels? Says Marlo. I don't know anything about Lemens. Nothing. Never seen him play a minute. Nothing. Purposely nothing. I am relying on scout reports and people who have seen him and I don't care. I put my hands up and say that. I don't want to be an expert on Lamemens. All I'm hearing is he could be the next Corttois. He's a really talented goalkeeper. He's good in the air and he's a good shots stopper. So I don't know whether what you're saying is true, Marlo. I don't know what the reality is. But with Martinez, I know exactly what he is for me. I've always put him in the top three goalkeepers in the league. Now people will say he makes mistakes. He's erratic. He's got a big personality, but I never knew we'd go for him. I've been asked this question on that football so many times because it happens in games. People will go, \"Who's the top three strikers? Who's the top three goalkeepers?\" I always put Martinez in the top three. So, if you're offering me up Lamemens or Martinez at my club where there is no patience and you lose one game and people want the manager to be sacked, every day of the week I'm saying get the experienced guy in because who do I want in goal against Man City away in two weeks time? Lamemen's making his debut or Martinez who's done it all before. It's got to be Martinez. I don't know whether it is going to be Martinez by the way because Fabitio Romano is basically saying that we're still in for both. I would happily buy both by the way. Martinez experience, Lmens is the understudy. But if it's an eitheror and we buy Lemens, I'm sort of like looking at it and going, but you know what? We might go for Lemens because sell on value. We might go for Lemens because of that because that's what Chelsea would do. Chelsea would go for Lemens, not Martinez because they like a sell-on value. So, let's see. Add Martinez. And once Kuna and Burma and Cesco hit match sharpness, we should have enough to get the results needed to keep Amarim in the job, says Eddie. But if we had a midfielder, I think we could go for fifth. I mean, Villa are losing now. Spurs lose yesterday. Newcastle have got two points from nine. If we went and got It's so irritating. Just got to calm down. It's so irritating. If we went and got a midfielder, I genuinely think with Martinez in goal, we could get fifth. If we had a good midfielder and Martinez on top of Kuna and Embero and Seshko, I think we could get fifth. I genuinely think we could get fifth. And I don't want to be sat there in January going, look, we would have got fifth. I really do think we could. And I would take Connor Gallagher because he's intense and he runs around and he can pass and he would be a good stop gap for a year that we might keep next summer and then buy another midfielder. But to get nothing is a joke. Agartate is unreliable. Kazmiro is old, Bruno is not a midfielder, and Mayu is potential and doesn't want to be here. It's a bad mix. So, unless we've got a surprise in the squad, Kone Mazawi play there, I don't know. I'm worried. Uh, David Rodriguez says, \"I'm tired of hearing all the great players that past managers have tried to bring in, but the board got someone else back in bring in his players,\" says David. Michael Cornish says, \"Surely we can do something with BB and Mayu goes to Brighton on loan.\" I mean look what I would say is I was listening to Fitzio and he said look the Villa Martinez story will not happen tonight because of Villa are playing. It'll be late tonight tomorrow morning that Villa talked to Man United about a fee. Martinez wants to come to Man United. Personal terms are not an issue. It's the fee for Aston Villa. Jaden Sancho could be involved going the other way. Um so we might get some reduction on the fee to be honest with you. you know, I don't know what much I don't know how that's going to help us, but hopefully we can do a deal with that. Hopefully, there is something we can do. Now, remember, and if you are a me if you well, if you're a member, thank you very much for getting your bad badge in. Um, but if you remember, I was we were t talking on one of our many brilliant eight o'clock shows over the transfer window and I actually said in mid July I had a theory that the goalkeeper we want is Martinez and we might try something right towards the end of the window when Emory and Martinez get back together again and realize they don't really get on. Um, it has come to pass it. There was there was no source on that. There was no information on that. It was just pure theory. The same theory we cooked up also in mid July that Bruno might have a promise to go to Saudi next summer uh as long as it's before June the 30th and all the money goes in this financial year. A third theory is why would you not do a deal with Man United for Ble and take Mayu for a year? But I don't see it happening because how would that happen? How would that happen? I don't know. Um, but it's a theory and until 7 o'clock at 7 o'clock tomorrow night, it could it could happen. Don't know what happened there. Um, anyway, that was from Michael Cornish. Thanks for your super chat. Be core says, \"Best moment to the window was the few hours when Cesco chose United. The belabour news broke and Ornstein credited Indie. I wonder if Ornstein now regrets it probably because wasn't it Indie talking about Stiller this afternoon or has he deleted it? Uh I I was doing a watch along so I don't actually know but I'm sure somebody was saying that they did mention Stiller as well. Um no, maybe they didn't. Maybe that's not true. um to be fair. Anyway, back to you. Evening Mark says Rocket Games HD. Do you think KBBY will stay and we will just act as if it's a new signing? I mean, Rocket Man United can act how they like. Um but we all know apparently it did happen and it got deleted. It's a shame when you know these so-called in the nose delete tweets, isn't it? I think that's a big indicator that they're not really in the know if you have to def delete your tweets. Um, but look, I think in relation to United not getting a midfielder, there's no spin that anyone's going to follow because let's remember when we went for Belaba, we had Mayu, Bruno, Casemiro, and Agate. So not getting a midfielder and Mayu staying is not like signing a midfielder because we had four anyway and we'll have four tomorrow when the window closes. So Mayu cannot Mayu staying cannot be classed as a new signing. Absolutely not. I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped dropped a new Mayu contract on Tuesday and class that as a new signing, but it can't be classed as a new signing because we need more than that. Um Lord Harky says, \"I'm new to your channel and I love it.\" Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. Is there any percentage chance PB could get the sack? Says Chris. Don't really care Chris because we've got our own problems to be honest. Um this is no uh thank you very much for that from Hat Lingen as well who started the show off. Uh do you rate Conaces Evan? Um until I see him in a first team I can't rate anybody. I know lots and lots of young players that are very highly rated but until I always say until they play for the first team it's not really relevant. Um, so look, there's high hopes for him. I bloody hope he comes into the team and he's brilliant, but I mean I don't know. It's a risk. He might not get used at all. He might not be good enough. I don't know. I think it's risky to say we don't need a midfielder because we've got Kone. Uh, what's with Bleaba pulled at 60 in the last two? Says Nectaria. Don't know. Uh, Mojo says we will get a midfielder, some loan deal or a free agent. They will find a plaster the cracks. You know what, Mojo? In a way, at this late stage, I would take a loan. I don't think we're going to do that. I I don't think we've got anything lined up. Well, as for tonight, I know we haven't. There's nothing lined up. So, I don't even know what the loan deal would be. I don't even know what's out there. Now, there are clubs out there doing very interesting things like Marseilles. I've got Vman from Livig on a year loan with an obligation to buy. So, you can do these. They're more prevalent. You can do loans for good players with an obligation to buy. But I I don't see as look if I'm being completely honest look at history. What do you end up with in the last 24 hours on a loan? Agalo veg host Seitza you know you don't necessarily end up with you you end up desperate don't you? Uh just have a feeling we'll get a last minute wild card midfielder says Paul. Look, honestly, I don't think it's going to happen based on what I've been told tonight, but in fairness, I was also told as part of that, Will Cox Amarim 100% one to midfielder. But as of tonight, there are no talks. So, I hope Paul, we get some last day drama tomorrow. But I feel to be honest with you, when you wake up at like seven o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock in the morning, you got 11 hours to do a goalkeeper deal. I don't see where the time comes. Remember, some transfer windows have traditionally closed at 11 p.m. It closes at 700 p.m. UK time. I I think we'll be doing all I think we'll be doing everything to get the goalkeeper in. I I just don't think there's time. I really don't. Um, Fairway 5 says, \"Romano's had a stinker this summer.\" I don't think he has at all. Don't know where you've been, mate. I absolutely No, I think he's had a very good summer. Uh, no club is going to buy an Anna or beinder, says Goblin. Uh, Ar I mean, yeah. Well, look, that is some we should almost be taking notes because tomorrow night when we're reviewing the transfer window, we're talking about bringing in Martinez or Lemens. Let's not forget Binda and Anana will still be here. The removal of players yet again has been incredibly crap and I don't see Beinda or Anana going either yet one of them or both of them do need to because you know Anana you bring Manat Manz if you bring Martinez in Anana's sat on his ass all season and beinder even worse so they should be talking to their agents trying to find a move But, you know, I think it says I think it speaks volumes of the modern footballer, but also the modern footballer at Manchester United. They've mismanaged their career because they don't value the thing they're paid to do. If I was a Man United player, Ganacho, Anthony, and Anthony, hello, remember Anthony? He's still here. Sancho's still here. Um but all these players, Ganacho, Malasia, Anthony, Sancho, Biinda, Anana, they've known all summer that they're not wanted, right? And here they are with 24 hours to go, apart from Ganacho, obviously, and they've got no club. Now, if you if you if you prioritized playing football, you'd get it sorted, but they've prioritized sitting on their ass. And now here we are. I respect the fact that Rashford went and got that move to Barcelona very very quickly. I respect the fact that Raasmus when he wasn't in the first match day squad went okay I want to stay. I want to fight. I feel as a backup striker I could challenge Seshko and play games and I think that's what he wanted to do. But when he wasn't in the match day squad for Arsenal and he wasn't in the matchday squad for Fulham I think he's gone look you know I don't need a I don't need the weatherman to tell me it's pissing down. I haven't got a future. I'm gonna get a future. I want to play football. And he he definitely wanted to stay at Man United. It was his dream. And he would have stayed as the backup. But when he's not on the bench, it's like, you know what? Okay, I get the message. And he's gone. Some of our players just haven't got the message because they don't value football, I don't think. Um Arshan says, um, \"S City points in three games. Are they talking about sacking Pep?\" No. No. Uh they're not because at Manchester United we have this ridiculous um obsession with sacking managers. Uh happy with the Emmy talks. Gutted no midfield. We sadly we suffer due to the incompetence of the club's own says James. Well look somebody just said in the live chat do you think we can just get by with the midfield that we've got? And I'd love to say yes, and I'd hope that we do, but multiple years of watching football and last year watching Manchester United, remember this is last year's midfield. That's my big thing. It's not It's not a stab in the dark. It's not a prediction. It's a fact that this is our midfield from last year. A fact. That is our midfield from last year. So, do I think we can get by with this midfield until next summer? No. No, I don't. I really don't. Because we saw what it was like last summer and we've seen what it's like this season. and you know they're not able to um they're not able to do anything about it, you know. They're not able to track runners, mark players up. They're just not specialist players, you know, and I think that's a problem. Him says, \"Get Bassuma on loan. Please do some research on Bassuma, mate. He turns up late for training. Um, he's got a ridiculously bad attitude. You're just chucking names around because you're desperate. I'd rather have nothing than Bassuma. He's got a really bad attitude. That's why he's got nothing to do with Thomas Frank's team. Um, get ready for a Calvin Phillips loan. Oh my god. Love hate games. Oh my god. Um, would you be happy with BA from Nice in relation to UEFA rules? We can't. We can apparently sign him on a September the 1st and his price is quite cheap, says Nabil. Don't know much about him to be honest. Unfortunately, we have collected players who are obsessed with the caviar and champers and lose sight of the bread and butter that keeps them alive, says Emily Derry. Thank you very much, Emily. Hope you're doing well. With Villa losing to Palace, they may keep Martinez, says Mindex. Um, would uh well, I I don't know about that. I think they're losing 2-0, aren't they? Um, would you do an interview with Ganacho? Anything goes, says Gareth. Yes. I don't think he'd do it, though. Would he? Inos have looked totally inept this window says bounty hunter. Lord Harky welcome to the members club. Thank you very much sir for joining in. Uh have you seen Villa have signed Lindelof says Cade. I mean the fact that Villa have gone for Lindelof and want Sancho I mean it seems to be getting worse. Would you take an Ander Herrera profile midfielder? 100% MGT. Yes. And if Martinez or Lemens comes in surely this means Binda is second choice and Anana third. Uh yeah, I think Anana's completely I'll give it a few seconds. Anana has completely and utterly messed this summer up. He gambled that United wouldn't buy a goalkeeper so he could be number one. He then got dropped for Binda and United are going to buy a goalkeeper. He's gone from gambling he'd be our number one to putting himself as number three. Absolutely messed up. Now he might not be bothered. He might be, well, I'm on 140 grand a week. I'll sit here and do nothing. But he's absolutely played this mid this summer transfer window terribly. And also it was March when he was told he's not going to be our goalkeeper. It was March when he was basically told we want you to start looking for a club. He's had long enough. Um if we don't get a midfielder, do you think Sir Grim calls Braillesford and orders him to send the Jiffy bags to Carrington? Says Paul Cassidy. I'd love Sabitza back on another loan, says Tom. Uh, do a loan swap with Mayu and Gallalagha, says Ben. No, I think if you were bringing Connor Gallagher in, you would want to keep Mayu. Um, Mitch Wright, thanks for your super chat. If we get Martinez, I believe we can get top five, says John Bo. We still have the same midfield problems, mate. And that midfield couldn't deal with Burnley. Mark, would the way Amarim is talking and acting be a worry? I'll back the man all day, but he looks like uh gives me what I need or I am gone, says Bounty Hunter. Look, if he doesn't get a midfielder and he goes, I'll applaud him out the building because he won't be getting a payoff. If you walk, you don't get a payoff. So, I would applaud a person who puts money secondary to morals and I would applaud a person who basically says they didn't back me up yours. I I would clap him out the building. It would be the most significant statement we've had since Sir Alex Ferguson left. Imagine if a manager on Tuesday said, \"I'm off. I'm I'm I'm giving up the 15 million severance pay. You didn't back me. I told you what I needed. I can't succeed. I'm off.\" I'd go, \"Fair [ __ ] play.\" I don't think he's going to do it. But I would say fair play. Um I think to be honest with you, he's already explained the whole threatening to leave stuff. He's a very passionate person and in the in the aftermath of a bad result, he sometimes says and does things he doesn't mean. Um but I don't think he's going to go anywhere. And also um I think there's a massive overreaction in the media yet again. Amarim's been Have you noticed how Amarim has had the piss taken out of him for doing the little tactics board? You know, they've turned it into connect four and stuff like that. Honor slot was doing exactly the same today. Oh, that's okay though. Arnest lot's got nine points from nine. He's just won the Premier League. So, it's okay for him to have a tactics board, but the Man United manager having a tactics board. Let's take the piss out of him like he's, you know, a little school kid with crayons. Um, also, I've seen so many people, again, Henry Winter was doing it, talking about his behavior is erratic and concerning. As did Did nobody watch Jurgen Klopp? Jurgen Klopp used to watch games going like this, turns his back, fisting the crowds, but you know that's fine because it's Jurgen Klopp. It's it's an absolute pile on the things that they scrutinize and make an issue. I don't care. Louis Van Hal fell on the bloody floor doing some sort of crap audition for Holly Oaks. Like it's irrelevant to me how Amarim is behaving because I don't find it erratic and I don't find it out of the ordinary. But you know what? If you live next door to somebody and you think they're dead normal, you know, I see them all the time, everything like that. And then someone turns up with little clips of them putting the bins out from a different angle and goes, \"Oh, look at him. Look at him. He looks a bit erratic. He's wearing his slippers to push them out.\" You know what they say about that? It's a conspiracy. It's a pylon. It's an agenda. They're they're jumping on absolutely everything about him because all they want to do is get you on side because when they get you on side, they can write more articles and make more money about Man United and getting the manager out. As I said, I think there are heads of media companies who go, \"We're all eating turkey and getting a Christmas bonus if we can get Amry out by Christmas because we drip drip drip now. we get more and more fans on side and by November he's sacked then it's a new manager Man United's the biggest seller back of the net and we all know it because we've seen it with Ollie Tenhog and Jose started at the start of the season right at the start of the season and they were all gone by Christmas and the noise was Man United Man United Man United and these media companies aren't stupid by the way they've got analysts they've got historical data They can look at, you know, October whatever the year Mourinho was sacked and October whatever the year Ollie was sacked and October 24 and go look at the spike in views and revenue that year. Look at look at that. What was that all about? Oh, that was because we're all piling on to Ollie to get him sacked or piling on to Jose, remember? Oh, well, what happens this year if we don't do that? Smaller spike, smaller revenue. Well, let's get on and hammer him then. Let's do it. And that's what's happening. But they need you. They need your ears. And that's why we're getting all these little clips and articles about, oh, he's erratic behavior. Senior players. What senior players? It's all a load of nonsense. 3-0 to Palace. I don't know what's going wrong at Villa. We're not the Villa stand, but one point from nine. Another contender. Another contender. Another contender for fifth place. Terrible start to the season. Newcastle, terrible start to the season. Spurs lost at home to Bournemouth. That fifth place is up for grabs. Why is Sir Jim Radcliffe the lifelong Man United fan? Imagine if I was the chair. Imagine if I was Sir Jim Radcliffe, right? You know, you you know, we talk all the time. You know, I'm passionate about United. Imagine I was the lifelong Sir Jim Radcliffe Man United fan, right? What would I be doing tonight? What would you be doing tonight? I'd be going, \"Bloody hell. Villa, Newcastle, Spurs are all vulnerable. Get me a goalkeeper. Get me a midfielder now. This is our chance. We're going to be back in the Champions League. 100 million pounds of revenue. Money, money, money. Club's back on the map. Get me a midfielder.\" How can he not be sat there as this lifelong Man United fan go get me a midfielder? I don't. Look, I have an understanding that if you're the Glazers, they don't understand what football is, let alone support Man United. So telling them we need a midfielder is going to be like, you know, speaking a language they don't understand. But Sir Jim Radcliff's meant to support Man United. And as a supporter of the club, you must watch games and go, what's happening in the midfield? End of the day, what? Forget the champers, you know what's happening in the midfield? Apparently, he likes football. Apparently he supports Man United. How is he not seeing that problem? Because all of you do. Every Man United fan knows the midfield is not good enough. But Sir Jim apparently doesn't. Does he not know football? Then is he a fake fan or is he powerless to do something about it? Because if he's a Man United fan, he knows we need a midfielder and he knows if we get a midfielder, we might get fifth place and then he gets a load of money. That helps him build his stadium. So I again I'm baffled by the fact that we spent two weeks trying to sign Ba, we didn't get him and then we've not got a midfielder in. Tell the whole world you need a midfielder. Everybody knows you need a midfielder and then don't get a midfielder. Crazy. Um, who do you think we're getting as a goalkeeper? Uh, well I'd like it to be Emmy Martinez Ram, but if Emory gets sacked tonight, they might keep him. I don't know. This is what happens when you leave it late. This window has to be judged as a whole. Even if the goalkeeper and midfield arrive, it's still poor. The delays have piled needless pressure on both the club and the manager, showing a failure in planning. John, I will applaud you because you know what? Even if we do get a midfielder and a goalkeeper, you still have to look at it in its entirety like John says. And it's way, way too late. I still want him, but it's weird. Really, really late, isn't it? Edwin Vanderar at 34. We got him. Martinez 32. Both have a lot of similarities. Could be needed badly, says Silent Hill. Um, what's your thoughts on Amos? Rumor is he's hopefully coming to Sheffield Wednesday. I like Amas. I think he reminds me of a young Luke Shaw in the way that he runs and the way that he plays. Um, you know, I hope he can go somewhere and play. We've not had a good record of loaning players out for a long time. I thought Dan Gore going on loan would work. Joe Hugal. It's not really gone the way I hoped, but hopefully it will with Amass. Um, thank you very much for that. Uh, has anyone noticed that Believer has been hooked in all three Prem games before 70 minutes? Uh, Dari, you're not the first person to mention that. Uh, Bryce is a new member. Welcome to the members club, Bryce. Who would be your ideal signing for the club? Says Mitch, right here, right now. believer because that's the one that Amarin wants. It's easy, isn't it? Um, one center midfielder for 38 games. What if injured or rotation? Back to factory reset then, says free kick. Do you think Emry will get the sack after this evening's battering? Says Marlo. I don't know what's going on at Villa, but there is something badly going on at Villa and I don't really understand it. You know, he's done so well there and they've been so good and they're so [ __ ] Like, I don't think they've scored a goal, have they? Um there's a reason why Amram is getting attacked even with context. He finished 15th. He finished 15th. He's not Pep. He's not Klopp. He's a guy who finished 15th. And you're a Pratt Rajine. And we'll move on. Inos two windows hit big with the lit Yoro Ka and Burmo Dorgu. We're suffering the incompetence of the Glazers. Now our fans pressure Amarim says Seth. Uh Robert McCormack's in the house. Glasnner's keep Glasgner keeps winning with this squad. It's amazing. You know what? There are a number of brilliant coaches in this league. The Bournemouth coach, the Fulham coach, and the Crystal Palace coach. They're brilliant. All three of them. Um to do what they do with the limitations they have is is remarkable. They they are I I agree. They are absolutely brilliant coaches and I hope that they get with all due respect to the clubs that they manage, I think they all deserve to to to coach at a higher level. The same as Thomas Frank at Brenford. The media butcher managers, which I disagree with. This is bounty hunter cam welcome to the members club. Thank you very much. Watts Mark what's for Netflix and chill. I don't know what you're on about rub villa Newcastle doing poor but only amarim on target says Shiva Valhalla welcome to members club as well. Look the only context I'm care I care about in relation to Villa and Newcastle is I think they're the two with Spurs who are fighting for fifth and I think all three of those clubs will strengthen big tomorrow. What are we going to do? What are we going to do? I think it's disgusting if we sign less than five players this summer. You know, Arsenal have signed eight players. Eight players Arsenal have signed. They finished second and they've signed eight. Now, I think that's brilliant for Arsenal. You need squad depth. Look at the injuries they've got. Hav Saka, Celiba, you know, you do need squad depth. Eight players Arsenal have signed and they finished second. Man United are apparently restructuring their whole club and building a system we've never played before and we've signed three. It's disgusting, isn't it? That sentence alone is disgusting. We've brought a manager in who plays a system we don't have the players for and in his first summer transfer window, we bought three players. Arsenal have bought eight for Arteta. Look, I never expected eight, but it had to be a minimum of five and they've failed. Um, Valhalla, welcome to the members club. Thank you very much. Um, Mad says, \"Jiao Nez would have been a dream last summer. Some player he's turning out to be. It's funny all the sixes we've looked at are doing well.\" Well, we did a deal that helped out PSG, didn't we? We took Agate. They got Nez. George Mendes did the deal. Um, you know, we hoped Agate would do well. I still think he can but um he looks bereff of confidence at the moment. Fasa says I think it's not talked about enough how bad starts some teams have had like City Villa and Newcastle but still we get all the attention. It's the context is key isn't it? As I said before a couple of minutes ago, if you want to know why Man United, the story, newspapers and online um outlets and media companies cannot survive on spending their time talking about Aston Villa and Newcastle and City, Villa and Newcastle as a threeheaded story every every day won't hit what just going for United would. It's a very cynical world and sometimes you got to be very very honest. If you are the head of a radio station or a TV company or a newspaper and you've got people saying really we should be doing Villa, Newcastle and City before we're doing Man United, the head's going to go even if we do three times the stories for those three clubs, we're not going to get the same amount of attention as we do if we slag Man United off. It is a fake and false media. It is an agenda media. It is a propaganda media because they use United because they know the most people. That's where they'll get the most interest. And that's why it's always us. And that's why Sir Alex created that siege mentality. And that's why our players need to switch on because if they're impacted by the noise of the media, just listen to that last few minutes. That's why they go after you because you're Manchester United and you get the most eyes and ears. Can you see Anana and Bind to go to Turkey or Saudi? The window is open after tomorrow. Great point. Great point. Yes, I can. Great point. The Saudi window and the Turkish window is open after hours. And yes, Binda to Turkey and Anarda to Saudi could happen, but we might need to keep one of them. Um, would you risk taking Rabiot on a Rabio on a one-year loan? Ask me that at 5:00 tomorrow because with two hours left in the window, I know exactly what I'll say. I'll say yes, but we shouldn't be going anywhere near it. Um, and I think he's going to AC Milan anyway. Uh, Mind X says, \"With Villa losing to Crystal Palace, they may keep Emmy and would you be happy?\" I've done that one from Nabil. Uh, thank you very much for that as well. Um, Mourinho Villa says, \"Dan, I got to say it would be ridiculous to sack Unai Emory after three games. I mean, you we talk about going in on Amarim, but you know, the job he's done at Villa, they were in the Champions League last year. They're in the Europa League this year. They'd be stupid to sack Emory. I'm always surprised at the shock. We are always in the news. It's supply and demand. Demand is high for news about United. The media supply it, says Nick Jay. Thank you very much, Nick. Jack Lansy says, \"Viller only have one point, but I don't hear the media going Emry needs to go or where Newcastle are at the moment.\" And Eddie How needs to go. Spot on, Jack. Villa will push for Lmens 100% by watching them tonight. Their keeper is like a nana, says Pete Jones. Um, Robert McCormack says, \"Villa lost Rashford and they went downhill.\" And what about Joel Pereira at Reading who played a blinder and made some great saves yesterday. I think he's miles above our current goalkeepers, says Daniel Pollard. Theory Galatasaray is still in for a keeper. Maybe an honor or bind bind a go if Emmy Martinez comes in. I thought they were getting Edison and then Donnaruma goes to them. Uh, has anyone noticed that? Yeah, I've done that one there. Let me just check something here. I need to find it. Um, good point there. Good point there. Paul Cassidy, I'd love Soul. I thought you said I'd love Sol back. Tom nearly nearly crapped myself then. Mitch Wright, thanks for your super chat. Um, I'm just looking for a comment here from somebody. Bear with me. Uh, John United, Andy Lee, Mojo, Evan, James. Oh, here we go. Dylan says, \"Could we get Belaba in January like we did with Bruno?\" Dylan, in all honesty, I can't stop people thinking like that. Why would I? But I despise it because you learn nothing. You basically become a cheerleader to this organization. What did I say about half an hour ago? Every year the summer transfer window closes and it's not gone the way we have. And it's normally Look, he normally does the club's bidding on this. He normally writes an article the day after the transfer window closes talking about how United are going to go big in January or the next summer. Never happens. Never happens. So, I wouldn't swallow it at all. Um, and as I said this morning, David Ornstein after the look, remember the January transfer window? We needed more than Doru. We definitely needed more than Dorgu. It was a crap window. The minute it closed, David Ornstein credible. Man United are going to go for Kender. They've already held talks and everyone forgot about the January transfer window because oh we're going to get Kender. A month later he's signing for Chelsea. So that was from Ornstein. Ornstein put it out there in early February that United were in talks with Kender and everyone forgot the January transfer window because we're in talks with Kender. He signed for Chelsea. I wouldn't believe anything about January or next summer. Nothing. We've been lied to before. Last year we thought we'd sold Sancho for 25 million. It was only in March we got told no it's not it's if they give us 5 million they can give him back. I don't believe anything that comes out at that club after a transfer window's closed. And on Belaba he hadn't signed a contract with us. We were we were the only offer this summer and he wanted to take it in January or next summer. He could have Real Madrid, PSG, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea. Are we going to be able to compete with them? So, I ain't I ain't swallowing any [ __ ] about we didn't get a midfielder, but we're going to get Ba next summer. Well, if you're going to get Ba next summer, why have we not signed him now for next summer? You can do that. It's been done with Kender. Kender's not at Chelsea yet. He's going next year. So, don't I won't I I don't believe it. I'm not going to leave. I'm not going to believe it. This whole we didn't do what needed to be done, but we'll promise we'll do it next year. Oh, I've never heard that before, have I? If you are telling us that we're getting Belaba next summer, then why don't you sign him now and pay next summer? Is Elliot Anderson still in the market? If so, would you like him if he's available? Well, he's not he's not available, is he? He's in the bloody England squad. Sergio, how has the media not called out the ownership? Multiple appointments that not worked is an ownership failure, not a managerial one. Uh Luca, not Luca. Um, Kofi, I've got no idea, no idea why the multiple Man United journalists never write about the ownership of Man United. Never do. In relation to transfers, I don't know why I've not read one article from the Athletic, the Manchester Evening News, the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, whatever. I've not read one article about how they've messed up this summer transfer window terribly. Nobody's writing about it. I don't know why. I'm not even going to speculate why. But the way I look at this window, we needed a minimum of five signings. We've done three. We needed a minimum of five sales. We've done one. We didn't get the striker in until choice six in late July. And Burmo, we spent nearly two months trying to sign, and he didn't get he wasn't ready for the uh for for preseason either. Um, it's been a really bad window, but it doesn't it doesn't seem to get mentioned. I mean, look, in fairness, one theory, people are just so used to it. I don't know. Um, what would really impress me from this ownership would be when everyone starts screaming am him out, they continue to back him and not throw him out, says Luca. Well, I hope I hope they would do that. Yeah. Was Bararda being honest, dishonest when he said they'd been planning this window for a long time, says Paul Cassidy. Um, I think we can all make our mind up on that. I'll give you my theory. When Bararda said that we've been planning this window for a long time and that we had two uh two plans, one with Europe and one without, um, I don't think he was lying. Um, because I think when you look at Ka and Emmo, I think they were obviously brought in. I think with the striker, if Dap had said yes, that would have been the striker. Um, it's just the query around the midfielder for me. I don't know who the midfielder was. I don't know. And the goalkeeper we've left very very late. Hi Jack. Hi Jack. Rabio Deal says Keel. Um, and Nick, thank you very much for that as well. Um, love a bit of crackling on my Sunday dinner. make or break for the dinner. What's your favorite bit of the dinner, says I do like crackling. Um I've not had a roast pork dinner for a long time because as you know and tomorrow I will be up and down sometimes in here and sometimes in the other room because I'm still having my kitchen done. Um I say I'm having my kitchen done. It's like people will be going why is it taking so long? Um I've had to have a wall down and stuff like that. So, we've not been able to cook properly for about six weeks. So, I haven't had a Sunday roast dinner for a long time, but I do like roast pork with a bit of crackling and definitely like it with some English mustard. Ryan, I I answered that in detail because it was a super chat and you know, I feel that you know, you should give time. Um, Ryan Davies says, \"What frightens me is that the transfer window is going to look a hell of a lot worse when the AFCON starts.\" Uh, Embero, Mazawi, Ahmad. Yeah, those three. Ana, but I mean, Embero, you'd cover off with Xerxy, Mount Kuna, Mazawi, we haven't even got at the moment. Uh, yeah, I think we'd be all right. I think we'll be all right. We should be going for Stiller, says Altters. You're never going to do a deal like that in 24 hours. What would really impress me? I've done that one from Luca as well. Um, thank you. It's getting a bit silly in here now. Has Premier League rivalries died down compared to 10 years ago? Says Rex. I've not near I've not nearly seen as much discussion about the rivalries throughout the league. You know what? This is a great point. I know I I know we're all focused on transfers, but there's really not a lot more to say, I don't think, unless anyone's got a different angle. Will Boyd, thank you very much for your super chat. I'm glad you mentioned this. Uh, would you take Enuisa, says Jesse, at this stage? Yes. Um, footy guy. Um, I I I've got no nothing to say. Uh, I don't I don't get involved in any of that. And yeah, I've got nothing to say. Um, has Premier League rivals died down? I will get involved in this, Rex. Um, I think at the end of the day, I've I've noticed this a long time, right? When we play Man City in a couple of weeks, there used to be a time when we played Liverpool, when we played Man City, where it would get really built up, like there'd be a lot of effort about building it up um all through the week. And now I don't know whether it's because of the volume of football we have. There's not really any buildup to these big games anymore. Um it's the biggest and the best league in the world and it's live but we don't really build up these games and I don't really know why. I was watching Liverpool Arsenal today and it was a bit boring for a bit and they were showing the crowd and they were all just sat there like this and then this the scary thing is and I think I have to put my hand up and say obviously we've got Bundesliga live TV rights on that's football and I've done two games obviously Bayern Munich at the Aliance is special but Hamburg against S Palley these are two teams that will be fighting relegation oh my Christ flares in the ground in in the stands, flags, the the passion and atmosphere is incredible. And we have got the big best league in the world and we have got the me best players players in the league in the world and we've got the best paid players in the world, but we've got [ __ ] atmospheres and we've got [ __ ] buildup to games. So, I think rivalries have suffered because of that because it's become a very corporate league, hasn't it? It's lost its soul. It's lost its rivalry. it's lost its identity. Um, the Premier League is the best league in the world and everybody knows it, but it's also the best league in the world because it's sponsored by the person who's it's just very commercial, the Premier League. Very, very commercial. It could be so much better. And it is the best league in the world. I'm not saying it's not, but it could be so much better. I mean, I've watched three games this weekend and every single one of them have said, \"The referee is [ __ ] Why is he not letting the game flow?\" little silly fouls where you could just let the game go and they've got no comprehension that that makes it a better game and it's more entertaining and people talk about the game more. So there's just so much but I genuinely think that when you look at the Bundesliga model and this 50 plus one and to be fair the Man United supporters trust were pushing for it for a long time. I think if you make clubs halfowned by the fans, you'll get better atmospheres because you look at the Bundesliga and those fans feel part of it. They feel like it's their club. They feel like they've got a say in the club and that leads to more rivalries. If you turned up to play Liverpool at Anfield and they own half of their club and we own half of our club, it it matters more when it's yours and it is ours, but it's not. We don't have a voice. The Glazers and Sajim say we're knocking Old Trafford down. They're knocking Old Trafford down. The Glazers and Sajim say we're not getting a midfielder. We're not getting a midfielder. It's not our club. It is ours, but it's not. But in Germany, it's your [ __ ] club. I think the membership at Bayern Munich is exceeds 50%. I think it's like 70%. So, look, we're never going to get that because the moneymen will never let it happen. But the reason we don't have those rivalries anymore, the reason we don't have those atmospheres anymore is because the Premier League commercialized football and it's become very, you know, sometimes a bit sterile. Um, but but there is no reason why German Bundesliga games have incredible atmosphere and the Premier League doesn't, apart from this commercialization of football. Because in the late 80s, and some of us are old enough to remember. Oh my god. I remember going to Hibbury in 88 or 89. [ __ ] hell. Oh god. It was the most excited and scared I've ever been. Like we were in the lower tier and Arsenal fans were in the upper tier and they were chucking cups of tea at us. But the atmosphere was incredible. And I was very fortunate to go to a few games when I was like six or seven um in the late 80s and the atmospheres were ridiculous. I mean some people call it hooliganism and there was some of that but the atmospheres were great. We can have those atmospheres in this country but it's very very difficult now. But remember but you know you know what it goes hand in hand doesn't it? And many Man United fans who are of a certain age will agree with me on this. The crowd atmosphere in the 70s and 80s is was way better than it is now. What's the difference between the 80s and 2025? Well, there was no Premier League. Footballers weren't on ridiculous money. Clubs felt more closer to the fans. When you feel close to a club, you get better. You get better atmospheres. When you feel you're a customer, you don't. It's as simple as that. And that is why when we're doing these Bundesliga games on that football, you come over and watch the atmosphere and go, \"Fucking hell.\" It's like night and day. Um the thing is I don't I've got to put my hand up and say I need to watch a few more Italian games and Spanish games because I don't know whether they get it as well. Uh but uh yeah, you can have those atmospheres in modern football. Some people go, \"Oh, it's tourists. It's everyone with a phone.\" Tourists go to bloody the yellow wall in Dortmund. Still getting a great atmosphere, aren't you? Um that was a bit of an after show, wasn't it? Right, let's get some sleep because tomorrow we feast. I hope so. Um to bed for tomorrow we feast. to bed for tomorrow we rise early and feast. Um I hope so. I hope something happens tomorrow. I look we we'll we'll end up with a goalkeep I mean God imagine if we don't end up with the goalkeeper as well. Is there any No. I mean you know if we don't get a goalkeeper I'm going from a four out of 10 to a three out of 10. We'll get a goalkeeper. We might even get some Look, we might get something tonight. We might be live again at 11 o'clock. We might get something tonight, but um we'll get a goalkeeper. Let's just all hope we get a midfielder. If we don't, I'm not going to sit here and say fifth is impossible, but it'd be ridiculously hard. But ridiculously hard. Um plan for tomorrow. We're going to be live for a lot of the afternoon from the studio uh with Beth and Co. Uh I'll be reacting to any stories that break while they're live. Uh, we've got a 10 o'clock show and yeah, busy day and then 8:00 tomorrow the windows closed. So, we will have our evening show. I don't know whether to do it at 7. Really, I should do it at seven. When the window closes at 7, I should instantaneously go live with the review show. I don't know what I shouldn't wait till 8. Should do it at 7:00, shouldn't I? What do you think? So, I just just I don't mind doing it at 8, but I just thought if the window closes at 7, surely I go live at 7 to review the window. Makes more sense, doesn't it? 7:30. Well, there's no logic in 7:30. Um, yeah, we'll see. We'll see. We'll talk about it on the morning show. My best friend used to play for Keslton in two. Um, Thomas Hassler, I think he used to play for them. Bundesliga, population of 100K, 50K at the stadium. It was crazy loud. I'm going to I'm going over a few. Um, no more football firms. Huligans partly says Jordan. Well, all these Bundesliga clubs have ultras, don't they? I don't think they're called ultras, but they they sort of they do have like community feel. Um, 6:45. There's no point doing 6:45 because we're live from the studio until 7 anyway for the last few hours. So, we will have live content for you till 7:00. I'm just thinking whether we go straight from the studio to me at seven or we do a normal 8:00. And I'm thinking seven. I think it makes sense. Thanks everyone for watching. Legends as always. Let's hope Look, one way or another, I saw somebody say it early one earlier. One way or another, in 24 hours it's over. We can't talk about signings because the door is shut. You can't do anything.
